## Description

Sun Skin Analysis is a desktop application developed using Tkinter, a Python GUI toolkit. It allows users to analyze their skin tone by capturing an image or uploading one. The program provides recommendations for the appropriate SPF (Sun Protection Factor) based on the detected skin tone. 

Additionally, it suggests clothing colors that will complement the user's skin tone, aiding in fashion choices.

The application also includes an additional feature for face analysis. It can detect wrinkles and under-eye dark circles, catering to individuals who are concerned about their appearance and skincare.

The main goal of this project is to provide users with a user-friendly tool for understanding their skin tone, protecting themselves from the sun, and making informed decisions about skincare and fashion.
